# Acid Curds

_Acid Curds_ is a basic chord sequencer.

The app provides **four 8-step chord progressions** (in total), and CV-control over various parameters, including chord type, progression length, direction, voicing, inversion, etc. The four chord progressions can be **chained** in various ways, providing progressions from **1 to up to 32 chords**. The chords/sequence data is stored along with the other settings (whenever settings are saved).

_Acid Curds_ can be used as either a basic quantizer / sample-and-hold type thing, in which case the chords will be formed on the basis of the incoming root CV, or it can be used as a step-sequencer, in which case the chord base-notes and chord properties will be fixed notes (chosen from a given scale) respectively features (inversion, voicing, etc); it’s also possible to combine sequencer and S+H type behaviors.

### Description

- the **chords editor** works much like the scale and sequence editors in [CopierMaschine](CopierMaschine), [Sequins](Sequins), etc:
    - in the main menu, select which progression (#1-#4) to edit by adjusting the `progression` parameter.
    - then right-click on the item `chords -->` to **open the chords-editor**:
        - adjust the progression **length** by pointing the cursor to the far right (using the LEFT Encoder), then turn the RIGHT Encoder.
        - turn the **right** encoder to change the selected chord-parameter (highlighted w/ white background).
        - turn the LEFT Encoder to either select which chord (step) to edit, or to select which step-feature to edit.
        - pushing the LEFT Encoder **toggles** between chord-select and feature-select.
        - push the RIGHT Encoder to close the editor again.
- a chord (or step) consists of five features: quality/type (`Q`), voicing (`V`), inversion (`I`), base note (`B`), and the register/octave (`O`); most of the parameter values should be fairly self-explanatory.
- the ‘base note’ (or root note) of a chord can be set to either `CV`, in which case a chord will be formed based on the voltage present at input CV1 (TR1 in that case is used as the S+H clock, the chords progression will advance depending on the `chords trg src` setting); or, it can be set to a fixed value: `#1`, `#2`, `#3`, etc (these values are given in scale degrees, e.g. choosing `#3` = the third note of a given scale).
    
- the `playmode` and `direction` settings offer various ways of moving through the sequence(s)
    - `-` (default): advance by trigger, using the chosen direction settings.
    - `SEQ+1 - SEQ+3`: ditto, but **cycling** through 2, 3, or 4 adjacent progressions (= chain up to 32 chords).
    - `TR3+1 - TR3+3`: ditto, but **jumps** to the next progression only _if/when_ a trigger is received at the **TR3** trigger inputs.
    - `S+H#1 - S+H#4`: CV-address, triggered by **TR3** (= **sample and hold**).
    - `CV#1 - CV#4`: CV-address, **free-running**.

### CV menu

- **enter** the CV menu by holding down the **down** button.
    - use the RIGHT Encoder to assign CV input channels 1-4 to a channel parameter (currently available parameters are: `root` (scale/global), `scale mask`, `transpose`, `octave`, `voicing`, `inversion`, `progression #`, `direction`, and `progression length`.
    - **return** to the main menu by either pressing the **up** or **down** buttons.
    - **clear** all mappings (per channel) by long-pressing the DOWN Button.

#### Tips

- Usually what trips people up is that by default there are two clocks involved:
    - TR1 = S+H
    - TR2 = “chord trigger”
- A pulse into TR1 will make the module sample the CV inputs (which won’t do anything if you choose a static ‘base’ note)
- A pulse into TR2 will actually step to the next chord in the progression (if any)
- You can map both types of behaviour to TR1, see the `chords trg src` parameter above
