# Applet Filtering

## Page 4: Applet Filtering

The fourth and final full-screen page in the [config menu](Hemisphere-Config) is for Applet Filtering.

Are you tired of scrolling past applets you never use? Now you can hide them with this filter!

_This setting is now saved in v1.8._

This is a full list of all the applets. RIGHT encoder push will toggle visibility of the selected applet. LEFT encoder push inverts the entire list. When an applet is hidden (unchecked), it is simply skipped when switching applets on the main view.
