**PolyDiv** is a set of 4 clock dividers running in parallel, driven by a single Clock and Reset. A combination of them can be routed to each output with a 2x4 matrix.

The CV inputs can be used to toggle **XOR** mode per channel - a positive voltage switches from the default logical **OR** operation to **XOR**. This means two simultaneous pulses from the selected clock dividers will cancel each other out, leading to more curious polyrhythmic patterns.

| CV INs | Ch 1 mode:<br>XOR (positive)<br>OR (zero) | Ch 2 mode:<br>XOR<br>OR |
| OUTs   |                Ch 1 Trigger sequence                |     Ch 2 Trigger sequence     |

### UI Parameters
* Division value for each of the four clock dividers
* Checkboxes to route pulses to outputs
