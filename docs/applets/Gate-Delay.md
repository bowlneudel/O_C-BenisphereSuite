Gate Delay is a dual trigger/gate delay loosely based on the Ladik S-189. Gate Delay has a 1ms resolution and a 2 second recording time. Modulation is bi-polar and can change the time by up to 1000ms.


### I/O

|        | 1/3 | 2/4 |
| ------ | :-: | :-: |
| TRIG   | Clock Ch1 | Clock Ch2 |
| CV INs | Time mod Ch1 | Time mod Ch2 |
| OUTs   | Delayed Trigger Ch1 | Delayed Trigger Ch2 |

### UI Controls
* Per channel: Set delay time, from 0ms to 2000ms
