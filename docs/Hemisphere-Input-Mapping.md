# Input Mapping

## Page 3: Input Mapping

The third full-screen page in the [config menu](Hemisphere-Config) is for remapping the software inputs to any of the physical jacks or any of the outputs A-D

Every applet has 2 trigger inputs and 2 CV inputs. Here, you can remap which physical inputs are routed to the applet's logical inputs. The trigger map settings also appear in [Clock Setup](Clock-Setup).

### Outside of Hemisphere
As of v1.8, the Input Mapping settings also affect other full-screen apps based on the Hemisphere Suite, such as Calibr8or, Scenes, Darkest Timeline, Enigma, etc. (but not the original stock Apps). This can be used to chain channels together in Calibr8or, or use a single input for multiple channels, or countless other experimental use cases.

The Input Map settings are only stored in and loaded from a Hemisphere Preset.
