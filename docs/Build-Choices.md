# Build Choices

By default, all [release builds](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-Phazerville/releases) include **Hemisphere** + all applets, plus **Calibr8or, Scenes, Pong, Piqued, Quadraturia, Passencore, Viznutcracker, Dialectic Ping Pong** (check the release notes to be sure)

Or you can roll your own! Generate a [custom firmware](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-BenisphereSuite/discussions/38) with your choice of Apps! (Read and leave a comment on the Discussion, and a robot will build it for you.)

## Your choices of [default builds](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-Phazerville/releases)

### Flipped Operation

Files with "_flipped" are for running the module upside-down.

### VOR

Files with "**+VOR**" are only for **Plum Audio / 4ROBOTS** hardware variants equipped with a _Variable Output Range_ circuit - O&C Plus, 1uO_c, & OCP X.

Standard 8HP uO_C, After Later uO_C 1U, or full-size 14HP O_C modules should be installed _without_ VOR - your outputs will behave strangely otherwise!

### Other options

Northern Lights modules (Buchla 4U format) and Teensy 4.x have their own default builds on the [Releases](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-Phazerville/releases) page
