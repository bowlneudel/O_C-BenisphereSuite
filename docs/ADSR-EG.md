*ADSR EG* is a linear envelope generator with two independent channels.

### I/O

|        |                1/3                 |                 2/4                 |
| ------ | :--------------------------------: | :---------------------------------: |
| TRIG   |           Channel A Gate           |           Channel B Gate            |
| CV INs | Env. A Release | Env. B Release |
| OUTs   |             Envelope A             |             Envelope B              |

Note that CV inputs modulate the release stage over a range of about -2.5 volts to about 2.5 volts. There is a small center detent in the middle of the range, at which point no modification will be made.

### UI Parameters

* Channel A: Attack duration
