## Page 2: Quantizer Setup

The second full-screen page in the [config menu](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-Phazerville/wiki/Hemisphere-Config) is for configuring 8 separate quantizer engines, which may be quickly selected & edited in any applet that uses quantization.

There are 8 global quantizer engines, each with a **Scale**, **Root Note**, and **Octave** setting. An encoder push will open the popup editor. Use LEFT encoder to change Scale, RIGHT encoder for Root Note, and UP/DOWN select buttons to jump octaves. Push either encoder again to exit. These gestures are the same when editing quantization settings in-applet.

Currently, settings for the first 4 quantizers can be reliably saved with [[Calibr8or]]. Some applets may also save/restore quantizer settings, but this may change.
