# VectorMod

![Screenshot 2024-06-13 15-52-20](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-Phazerville/assets/109086194/507d8a1c-8acc-4d71-9a38-0f155cf3e623)

VectorMod is a dual triggered one-shot or cycling modulation source based on Vector Oscillator waveforms. There is a variety of built-in waveforms from which to choose, or you can create your own with the [Waveform Editor](Waveform-Editor).

### I/O

|        | 1/3 | 2/4 |
| ------ | :-: | :-: |
| TRIG   |  Trigger Ch 1   | Trigger Ch 2    |
| CV INs | Cycle Ch 1 > 3v    |    Cycle Ch 2 > 3v |
| OUTs   |  Ch 1   |  Ch 2   |


Controls
* Mod 1 frequency
* Mod 1 waveform select
* Mod 2 frequency
* Mod 2 waveform select

The speed of the Modulator is determined with a single frequency control. The higher the frequency, the faster the Modulator will run.

VectorMod is in Hemisphere Suite starting with v1.6.
